# Final-project
	My final program is called the Journey to the West. It is a role play game based on an ancient Chinese novel. The game will be in
	the form of 2D scroll. And I will use pygame to implement it.
	The first interface will have a start icon and setting icon. If the player clicks setting, she/he can choose the adjust the volume 	of the background music or turn off the music completely. If the player clicks on the start icon, she/he can choose to start a new 	game or continue existing game."\n"
	As click on the new game button
	The player can control the character by pressing keys on keyboard. For example, if pressing “J”, the character will jump; pressing 	“D”, the character will go right; “A” the character will go left."\n"
	Each scene will consist of two parts: the scrip part and the fight part. The scrip part is basically clicking on different NPCs 	and having conversation with them according to the scrip. This part is to walk the player through the story line of the game. The 	fight part is fight monsters in the scene. There will be different monsters in different scene. At the end of the fight scene, after 	clearing all the minor monsters, there will be a boss, from whom the character can get different equipment."\n"
	There would be more ways than simply killing the monsters and boss to pass the scene. But if the player wants to get equipment 		from the boss, the boss has to be killed."\n"
