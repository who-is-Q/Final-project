# Final-project
	REMINDER: Please place the file on the "Desktop", so the program could run.
	    My final program is called the Journey to the West. It is a role play game based on an ancient Chinese novel.
	The game will be in the form of 2D scroll. And I will use pygame to implement it.
	    The first interface will have a start icon and setting icon. If the player clicks setting, she/he can choose
	the adjust the volume of the background music or turn off the music completely. 
	    If the player clicks on the start icon, she/he can choose to start a new game.As click on the new game button,
	an instruction would pop up.
	    The player can control the character by pressing keys on keyboard. For example, if pressing “J”, the character
	will jump; pressing “D”, the character will go right; “A” the character will go left; press "K" or "L", the character
	will attack.(the "K" attack and "L" attack can cause different amount of harm, and their ranges are different).
	    Each scene will consist of two parts: the script part and the fight part. The script part is basically clicking on 
	different NPCs 	and having conversation with them according to the script. This part is to walk the player through
	the story line of the game. The fight part is fight monsters in the scene. There will be different monsters in 
	different scene. And for some scenes, the player can choose to follow the developer's hint to find a way to resolve
	the fight, rather than simply fighting the monster untill no blood left.(The script of attacking monster to pass
	this scene and using the special way to pass the scene is different)
	
	    There is a bug I intended to make: the player cannot die. That is due to the amount of blood the second monster
	is too high, if I make the character could die, it will be impossible to kill the second monster by attacking it.
